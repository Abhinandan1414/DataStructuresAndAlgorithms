# What is the contribution of this Repository??
Prof. David Galles,Computer Science, Univerisity of San Francisco has provided the download in the path [1] as Source code: projects.tar.gz. However if you want to build the projects on your own **refactoring** is needed. 

#This Repository does exeactly that:

#How to use this Repository?
Clone the Repository.
Go to cd ds/main you will see build.xml and execute.sh
At the Linux command prompt type chmod 755 execute.sh
Ensure that Apache Ant is installed in the system. 
At the Linux command prompt type ./execute.sh
You are done!!

# Alter/modify the Algorithms as per your study purpose
# Tested with JAVA14.0.1
